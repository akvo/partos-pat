This way it becomes easier for partners to reflect on their power relations and agree on changes where necessary. This is the first major update of the Power Awareness Tool. The first version, the PAT 1.0, was launched by Partos in February 2020. Since then, several Partos members and their partners have been using the PAT. In 2022 the PAT 1.0 was evaluated. The evaluation examined user experiences of the Power Awareness Tool among Partos members and their Southern partners, mainly in the context of the partnerships that have been established in the framework of the Power of Voices programme. Over 70 users contributed to the evaluation. The evaluation examined user experiences of the Power Awareness Tool among Partos members and their Southern partners, mainly in the context of the partnerships.",
