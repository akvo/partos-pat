		"aboutDescription": "The PAT is a tool that can be used to facilitate, in a very structured way, a frank and open-minded discussion among partner organisations about the way important decisions are taken and should be taken. \n\nAs the name suggests, the PAT makes partners aware about power relations in partnerships. Whereas power has many dimensions, the PAT focuses specifically on decision making power in partnerships. The core question in a PAT session is about: who in a partnership is taking decisions about what. This is important, because in many partnerships this is not very clear. Decisions are being taken while not necessarily everyone is aware that this is happening. Often nobody has any quarrel with this. Maybe everyone agrees with the decision, or agrees that the ones who have taken the decision have the mandate to do so. \nHowever, there are also situations in which some partners feel unhappy about how a decision has been taken. They believe that they have not been involved in a proper way. Maybe they believe they should have been the ones to take this decision, or they had wanted to have an equal vote in taking the decision. Maybe they feel that they have not been properly consulted. If such situations happen frequently, it may lead to frictions that undermine the partnership. The PAT helps to anticipate such situations by making partners more aware of where decision-making power is located in the partnership. The PAT makes power visible, and when it is visible, partners are in a position to discuss and agree on who should be involved in which way in taken certain decisions. This way the partnership is more likely to remain healthy.\n\nPlease note that the PAT does not prescribe how partner organisations should be involved in decision-making. That is up to the partners themselves to agree on. The PAT helps to have a frank and open-minded dialogue about how partners should be involved in decision-making. ",

		"howItWorkDesc": "There is widespread consensus that in partnerships for development, donors, and international NGOs have too much power, and local NGOs in the Global South too little. Despite this consensus, the power imbalances persist. Apparently, it is hard to put the principles into practice. Those with the most power, usually the donors, and to a lesser extent the INGOs, are not always the most knowledgeable about the local situation or about the change needed and how. While there is broad consensus on this, power imbalances persist. We believe this is partly because power is in many ways elusive.

Each participant should come up with at least one important decision taken in the partnership in the past, that they would like to be reflected on in the PAT session. If the PAT is used in a starting partnership that does not have a long track-record of decision-making, participants should be asked to think of at least one important decision to be taken in the near future.\u00a0Please note: the reflection is meant to be about the decision-making process and not about whether the decision was good or bad.\u00a0 Core questions that will be addressed in the PAT session are: Who was involved in taking this decision and how?\u00a0 Are we satisfied with the decision-making process, or is there room for improvement?\u00a0After all participants have made their contributions, the facilitator makes a list of all these decisions. If some of the participants mention the same decision or the same type of decisions, these are grouped together in one category.\u00a0\u00a0Please note that formulating the decisions in an unambiguous and meaningful way can be challenging. The challenge is to formulate decisions in a way that they are not too general and not too specific.For example, Decisions about the allocation of resources can be a formulation that is too broad for having a meaningful discussion. Every partner will, in one or another way, have some decision-making power in the allocation of resources. This issue is, at what level? Therefore, in many cases it could be better to split allocation of resources into several sub-categories such as for example:\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decisions about the allocation of resources among countries\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decisions about the allocation of resources among partners in a country\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decisions about the allocation of resources to specific projects\u00a0There is also a risk in becoming too specific and making too many sub-categories of decsions. Bear in mind that each sub-category tends to be discussed. If the subcategorization is too detailed, such discussions may end up in tiresome and time-consuming splitting of hairs. Avoid this through focusing on the big issues.\u00a0If this list is becoming very long (more than 10 for example) it could be useful to prioritize. This could be done by asking each participant to indicate the top 5 decisions that need to be discussed in this PAT session. The decision that gets the most votes is put on top of the list, followed by the decision that gets the second highest number of votes, followed by the decision that gets the third highest number of votes etc.",

For this we use the ladder of participation in decision-making. Depending on the level of participation, the a score will range between 0 (not involved) and 4 (partner decides).\nFor each partner organisation and each decision, the level of participation will be determined through a brief discussion among participants moderated by the facilitator. From practice we have learned that this is a rather straightforward process. However, if participants have diverging perspectives of the way their organisation or other partner organisations are involved in the decision making, the facilitator needs to lead partners in a discussion in which they share evidence and experiences on what actually happened when these decisions were made.",
