		"helpStep1Text3a": "Preferably, participants can be asked before the PAT session to come up with decisions that they want to reflect on. This approach is recommended because it saves valuable time during  the PAT session, and it gives the facilitator more time to prepare the list of important decisions.  ",
		"helpStep1Text3b": "\nAlternatively, if participants cannot contribute to the list of decisions beforehand, they can be asked in the PAT session to take some 15-20 minutes for themselves to contemplate decision making in the partnership and contribute to the list.",

		"helpStep1Text4c": "If this list is becoming very long (more than 10 for example) it could be useful to prioritize. This could be done by asking each participant to indicate the top 5 decisions that need to be discussed in this PAT session (voting).",
		"helpStep1Text5": "<b>How to formulate decisions?</b>\n\nPlease note that formulating the decisions in an unambiguous and meaningful way can be challenging. The challenge is to formulate decisions in a way that they are not too general and not too specific.For example, Decisions about the allocation of resources can be a formulation that is too broad for having a meaningful discussion. Every partner will, in one or another way, have some decision-making power in the allocation of resources. This issue is, at what level?

		"helpStep2Text2": "For each partner organisation and each decision, the level of participation will be determined through a brief discussion among participants moderated by the facilitator. From practice we have learned that this is a rather straightforward process. However, if participants have diverging perspectives of the way their organisation or other partner organisations are involved in the decision making, the facilitator needs to lead partners in a discussion in which they share evidence and experiences on what actually happened when these decisions were made.",
		"helpStep3": "In step 3 the facilitator takes the group through the list of decisions, one by one. With regard to each of these decisions the facilitator asks the question: Do we agree with the way partner organisations are involved in taking these type of decisions? Remember, you are not discussing if the decision was right or wrong, but whether the partners involved agree with the level of decision-making and distribution of decision-making power.",

	"FAQ": {
		"faqs": "FAQS",
		"title": "Frequently asked questions",
		"subTitle": "Everything you need to know about the Power Awareness Tool (PAT)",
		"question1": "What is the Power Awareness Tool?",
		"answer1": "The Power Awareness Tool helps partners become aware of power relations in partnerships by making them visible. The tool offers a digital platform and guidelines to facilitate a conversation among partners to identify relevant decision-making topics and reflect on the current and desired level of decision-making power in partnerships.",
		"question2": "Why should I use the Power Awareness Tool?",
		"answer2": "The PAT offers a first step in the direction of making your decision-making in global partnerships more equitable. Here’s why:",
		"answer2a": "The PAT can help you to <b>facilitate</b>, in a very structured way, a frank and open-minded discussion among partner organisations about the way important decisions are taken and should be taken. Being aware of power in decision-making can be relevant when working in a consortium of partners.",
		"answer2b": "The tool allows the different stakeholders to <b>share</b> and <b>monitor</b> their insights on their decision-making practices within their projects, programs, and partnerships. This makes it easier for partners to reflect on their power relations and agree on changes where necessary. ",
		"question3": "Why did Partos develop the Power Awareness Tool?",
		"answer3": "Partos facilitates the transition towards more equitable partnerships within development cooperation, by co-creating practical solutions for systems change. Decision-making power in international partnerships is often highly imbalanced, with Global North actors playing a leading role in deciding over programs, budgets, and other decision-making topics.\n\nWithin this gap, this tool was developed to promote and work to shift power, understand the effects of power dynamics on the decision-making process, and create transparency on why, how and by whom decisions are being made.",
		"question4": "Why is it important to talk about power in partnerships?",
		"answer4": "Talking about Power in decision-making is important because, in many partnerships, this is not very clear. Power is often exercised implicitly. Decisions are being made while not everyone knows this is happening, or because it is the ‘norm’. However, there are also situations in which some partners feel unhappy about how a decision has been taken. Perhaps because there was limited involvement, consultation, or no equal vote in making the decision. If such situations happen frequently, it may lead to frictions that undermine the partnership.\n\nThe PAT helps to anticipate such situations by making partners more aware of where decision-making power is located in the partnership. By visualizing power, partners are in a position to discuss and agree on who should be involved in which way in making certain decisions. This way the partnership is more likely to remain healthy.",
		"question5": "What has been the impact of the Power Awareness Tool according to its users?",
		"answer5": "Partos has elaborately evaluated the PAT, with the main conclusion: in most cases, the Power Awareness Tool works.",
		"answer5a": "A large majority of respondents (79%) indicated that the PAT exercise did lead or will lead to follow-up actions to balance the power relations between the partners.",
		"answer5b": "Almost half of the respondents reported enhanced awareness about power relations. One-third stated that the PAT allowed them to identify areas of improvement within their partnership cycle.",
		"answer5c": "Other reported results include ‘enhanced trust’, and ‘correction of a misconception of power divisions in partnerships’.",
		"question6": "When to use the Power Awareness Tool?",
		"answer6": "The PAT can be used in various moments and processes to address power relations in decision-making in partnerships. F.e.",
		"answer6a": "During the design and start phase of a new partnership (baseline).",
		"answer6b": "To evaluate and continue monitoring decision-making in partnerships (mid & end term).",
		"answer6c": "To inform strategy and policy decisions on partnerships & programs.",
		"answer6d": "To evaluate the experience and satisfaction of decision-making processes among global partners.",
		"question7": "How do I facilitate a PAT Session?",
		"answer7": "If you want to facilitate a PAT session you simply create a new PAT session (as a facilitator) and share the invitation to participants that will represent the partners. Once, you start the PAT session, you can just follow the steps in the tool.  \n\nWe created <link>Facilitators Guidelines</link> to help you out. You can also find the guidelines at every step of the PAT session, by clicking on the question mark.\n\nThe Power Awareness Tool is designed to enhance the facilitator and user experience by making it simplifying and automating the steps. However, we invite facilitators to use their creativity and facilitation skills to make the process inclusive and interactive.",
		"question8": "Who should facilitate a PAT session?",
		"answer8": "A PAT session needs a facilitator. That can be a facilitator from within the partnership or an external facilitator. From the evaluation of the PAT 1.0, we found that most partnerships prefer working with an external, neutral facilitator. To avoid a Northern or Southern bias in the facilitation, it was suggested to work with a team of two facilitators, one from the North and one from the South. The facilitator is the only one who can create a PAT session, proceed through all the steps, and close a PAT session for all participants.",
		"question9": "Which video conferencing tool can be used to facilitate a PAT session online?",
		"answer9": "Any video conferencing tool with the possibility to share the screen of the facilitator is suitable.",
		"question10": "Should participants log in to their personal PAT account to participate in an online PAT session?",
		"answer10": "No, during an online PAT session it is important to join the video conferencing space initiated by the facilitator. During the online session, the facilitor’s screen is shared. All participants follow the proceeding via the facilitator’s shared screen.",
		"question11": "Why do I need to create a PAT account?",
		"answer11": "There are many benefits of creating a PAT account, both as a facilitator and participant. It is useful to open a PAT account to:",
		"answer11a": "Initiate, edit, and facilitate PAT sessions as a <b>facilitator</b>.",
		"answer11b": "Register as a participant in the session you are participating in.",
		"answer11c": "Access and view active PAT sessions, and add your comments to the PAT process (step 6) as a <b>participant</b>",
		"answer11d": "Access, view, and download reports of closed PAT sessions as <b>facilitator</b> or <b>participant</b>, after the PAT session has been closed.",
		"question12": "Should the PAT be held in one, uninterrupted in-person or online session?",
		"answer12": "No, the PAT can also be organised over a prolonged period with a combination of in-person and online sessions, as long as the sequence of the steps remains the same. Organisations have experimented with various combinations, f.e: ",
		"answer12a": "Step One (identification of important decisions) can be done by email or app over a period of several days or weeks.",
		"answer12b": "The same applies to Step Two (determining the actual level of participation in decision-making). One organisation used Survey Monkey for partners to indicate the actual level of participation in decision-making.",
		"answer12c": "Subsequent steps 3, 4, and 5 require higher levels of interactivity and are best conducted in in-person or virtual sessions.",
		"answer12End": "It is advised to design the PAT process with the facilitator of the session.",
		"question13": "What is the ideal size of a PAT discussion group?",
		"answer13": "<b>Organisations:</b> The PAT is optimized for the participation of up to 8 partner organisations. It is possible to join a PAT Session with more organisations, but this will have an influence on the visibility of the report and the tables. \n\n<b>Participants:</b> Experience suggests that, similar to focus group discussions, having 8-12 participants works very well. A smaller group is also possible, but facilitation becomes difficult with more than 12 participants. To avoid big groups, it is suggested that each partner should be represented by only one person. This is to avoid that some partners dominate the discussion because they are with more than one representative.",
		"question14": "Who to invite for a PAT session?",
		"answer14": "Once a PAT Session is created, you can send an invitation to the people in the partner organisations to join this session. It is crucial that the person representing a partner is well informed about how their organisation is involved, or is not involved, in taking important decisions in the partnership.",
		"question15": "What to do if more people from the same partner organization want to attend?",
		"answer15": "There may be good reasons for having more than one person of the same partner organisation participating in a PAT session. If that is the case, it is important to make sure that:",
		"answer15a": "At least one of the partners' participants knows how their organisation is involved in decision-making processes in the partnership.",
		"answer15b": "The participants of that partner choose one representative to actively participate in the scoring in steps 2 and 4. So, when it comes to scoring the actual level of participation (step 2) and the desired level of participation (step 3), each partner speaks with one voice through the representative.",
		"question16": "What to do if there are too many partners to invite them all to a PAT session?",
		"answer16": "In this case, it is possible to invite one or a few typical partners, assuming that their perspective on power is representative of the group. In case of doubt, it is important to test this assumption afterwards. This can be done by asking some of the other partners who were not present at the session whether the opinions of the ones representing them.\n\n<b>It is possible that a partnership consortium consists of dozens or hundreds of partners spread across a geographic region.</b>",
		"question17": "How to invite participants to come up with decisions that they want to reflect on?",
		"answer17": "This step can be facilitated in various ways. Preferably, participants are asked before the PAT session to come up with decisions that they want to reflect on. This approach is recommended because it saves valuable time during  the PAT session, and it gives the facilitator more time to prepare a clustered list of important decisions. Alternatively, if participants cannot contribute to the list of decisions on beforehand, they can be asked in the PAT session to take some 15-20 minutes for themselves to contemplate decision making in the partnership and contribute to the list.",
		"question18": "How can important decisions be formulated in an unambiguous and meaningful way?",
		"answer18": "The challenge is to formulate decisions that are balanced between being too general and too specific. For example, Decisions about the allocation of resources can be a formulation that is too broad for having a meaningful discussion. Every partner will, in one way or another, have some decision-making power in allocating resources. Therefore, in many cases, it could be better to split the allocation of resources into several sub-categories, such as for example:",
		"answer18a": "Decisions about the allocation of resources among countries.",
		"answer18b": "Decisions about the allocation of resources among partners in a country.",
		"answer18c": "Decisions about the allocation of resources to specific projects.",
		"answer18End": "There is also a risk of becoming too specific and creating too many subcategories. Bear in mind that each subcategory needs to be discussed. If the subcategorization is too detailed, such discussions may end up in tiresome and time-consuming splitting of hairs. Avoid this by focusing on the big issues.",
		"question19": "We want to include the donor in our analysis but do not want the donor to participate in the PAT session. What should we do?",
		"answer19": "It is possible to have one participant act as the donor in the PAT session. It is important to be aware that this ‘stand-in’ donor representative might not understand the donor perspective completely",
		"question20": "Can the PAT be used for evaluations or mid-term reviews?",
		"answer20": "Yes, during a workshop about PAT 2.0 in May 2023, several organisations reported that they had successfully used the PAT to evaluate power relations in a partnership.",
		"question21": "Can the PAT also be used within organisations to analyse power relations between different parts of the organisation?",
		"answer21": "This is possible. For example, <b>by an international NGO with headquarters in one country and country offices in several countries.</b>\n\nInstead of analysing power relations between partners, the participants will analyse power relations between the different offices, units and committees.",
		"question22": "Why not include a generic list of important decision-making topics?",
		"answer22": "Decisions considered important in one partnership may not be that important for another. For example, if the partnership is composed of partners responsible for their own fundraising, decisions about allocating resources may not be a big issue. But if partners raise funds together, decisions about the allocation of resources become very important.\n\nWe also learned that partners preferred to self-determine the decision-making topics together, rather than work with a pre-defined list that can be perceived as top-down.\n\nIn PAT 1.0, we included a generic list of examples of decisions, but this sometimes caused confusion and unnecessary discussions. That’s why we did not include a generic list in the main text of this PAT 2.0. Nonetheless, <link>a generic list</link> can be useful as part of Step One, provided it is handled with care. The facilitator should avoid lengthy discussions about this list. Some of these decisions may be important in your partnerships, whereas others are not important at all. Please note that in your partnership, there can be decisions that don’t feature at all in this generic list."
