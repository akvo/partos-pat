		"aboutTitle": "About the\nPower Awareness Tool",
		"aboutDescription": "The PAT is a tool that can be used to facilitate, in a very structured way, a frank and open-minded discussion among partner organisations about the way important decisions are taken and should be taken. \n\nAs the name suggests, the PAT makes partners aware about power relations in partnerships. Whereas power has many dimensions, the PAT focuses specifically on decision making power in partnerships. The core question in a PAT session is about: who in a partnership is taking decisions about what. This is important, because in many partnerships this is not very clear. Decisions are being taken while not necessarily everyone is aware that this is happening. Often nobody has any quarrel with this. Maybe everyone agrees with the decision, or agrees that the ones who have taken the decision have the mandate to do so. However, there are also situations in which some partners feel unhappy about how a decision has been taken. They believe that they have not been involved in a proper way. Maybe they believe they should have been the ones to take this decision, or they had wanted to have an equal vote in taking the decision. Maybe they feel that they have not been properly consulted. If such situations happen frequently, it may lead to frictions that undermine the partnership. The PAT helps to anticipate such situations by making partners more aware of where decision-making power is located in the partnership. The PAT makes power visible, and when it is visible, partners are in a position to discuss and agree on who should be involved in which way in taken certain decisions. This way the partnership is more likely to remain healthy.\n\nPlease note that the PAT does not prescribe how partner organisations should be involved in decision-making. That is up to the partners themselves to agree on. The PAT helps to have a frank and open-minded dialogue about how partners should be involved in decision-making. ",
