		"aboutDescription": "The PAT is a tool that can be used to facilitate, in a very structured way, a frank and open-minded discussion among partner organisations about the way important decisions are taken and should be taken. \n\nAs the name suggests, the PAT makes partners aware about power relations in partnerships. Whereas power has many dimensions, the PAT focuses specifically on decision making power in partnerships. The core question in a PAT session is about: who in a partnership is taking decisions about what. This is important, because in many partnerships this is not very clear. Decisions are being taken while not necessarily everyone is aware that this is happening. Often nobody has any quarrel with this. Maybe everyone agrees with the decision, or agrees that the ones who have taken the decision have the mandate to do so. \nHowever, there are also situations in which some partners feel unhappy about how a decision has been taken. They believe that they have not been involved in a proper way. Maybe they believe they should have been the ones to take this decision, or they had wanted to have an equal vote in taking the decision. Maybe they feel that they have not been properly consulted. If such situations happen frequently, it may lead to frictions that undermine the partnership. The PAT helps to anticipate such situations by making partners more aware of where decision-making power is located in the partnership. The PAT makes power visible, and when it is visible, partners are in a position to discuss and agree on who should be involved in which way in taken certain decisions. This way the partnership is more likely to remain healthy.\n\nPlease note that the PAT does not prescribe how partner organisations should be involved in decision-making. That is up to the partners themselves to agree on. The PAT helps to have a frank and open-minded dialogue about how partners should be involved in decision-making.",

		"howItWorkDesc": "There is widespread consensus that in partnerships for development, donors, and international NGOs have too much power, and local NGOs in the Global South too little. Despite this consensus, the power imbalances persist. Apparently, it is hard to put the principles into practice. Those with the most power, usually the donors, and to a lesser extent the INGOs, are not always the most knowledgeable about the local situation or about the change needed and how. While there is broad consensus on this, power imbalances persist. We believe this is partly because power is in many ways elusive. Therefore, Shift-The-Power-Lab developed the Power Awareness Tool ",

	"FAQ": {
		"faqs": "FAQS",
		"title": "Frequently asked questions",
		"subTitle": "Everything you need to know about the Power Awareness Tool",
		"question1": "Can the PAT also be used within organisations to analyse power relations between different parts of the organisation? Can it be used, for example, by an international NGO with headquarters in one country and country offices in several countries?",
		"answer1": "This is possible. Instead of analysing power relations between partners, the participants will analyse power relations between the different offices, units and gremia.",
		"question2": "Should the PAT be held in one, uninterrupted in-person (with the participants' physical presence) or online session? ",
		"answer2": "No, the PAT can also be organised over a prolonged period with a combination of inperson and online sessions, as long as the sequence of the steps remains the same. Organisations have experimented with various combinations. Step One (identification of important decisions) can be done by email or app over a period of several days or weeks. The same applies to Step Two (determining the actual level of participation in decision-making). One organisation used Survey Monkey for partners to indicate the actual level of participation in decision-making) Subsequent steps 3, 4, and 5 require higher levels of interactivity and are best conducted in in-person or virtual sessions.",
		"question3": "What is the ideal size of a PAT discussion group?",
		"answer3": "Experience suggests that, similar to focus group discussions, having 8-12 participants works very well. A smaller group is also possible, but facilitation becomes difficult with more than 12 participants. To avoid big groups, it is suggested that each partner should be represented by only one person. It is crucial that this person is well informed about how his/her organisation is involved, or is not involved, in taking important decisions in the partnership. A second reason for each partner being represented by only one person is to avoid that some partners dominate the discussion because they are with more than one representative.",
		"question4": "What to do if more persons of the same partner want to attend?",
		"answer4": "There may be good reasons for having more than person of the same organisation participating in a PAT session. If that is the case, it is important make sure that:",
		"answer4a": "At least one of the partners' participants knows how their organisation is involved in decision-making processes in the partnership.",
		"answer4b": "The participants of that partner choose one representative to actively participate in the scoring in steps 2 and 4. So, when it comes to scoring the actual level of participation (step 2) and the desired level of participation (step 3), each partner speaks with one voice through the representative",
		"question5": "What to do if there are too many partners to invite them all to a PAT session? This can, for example, be the case if a national partner works with dozens or hundreds of local partners spread across the country.",
		"answer5": "In that case, it is possible to invite one or a few typical local partners, assuming that their perspective on power is representative of the group. In case of doubt, it is important to test this assumption afterwards. This can be done by asking some of the other partners who were not present at the session whether the opinions of the ones representing them.",
		"question6": "We want to include the donor in our analysis but do not want the donor to participate in the PAT session. What should we do?",
		"answer6": "It is possible to have one participant act as the donor in the PAT session. It is important to be aware that this ‘stand-in’ donor representative might not understand the donor perspective completely",
		"question7": "Can the PAT be used for evaluations or mid-term reviews?",
		"answer7": "Yes, during a workshop about PAT 2.0 in May 2023, several organisations reported that they had successfully used the PAT to evaluate power relations in a partnership.",
		"question8": "Why not include a generic list of important decisions to be taken in partnerships with CSOs?",
		"answer8": "Decisions considered important in one partnership may not be that important for another. For example, if the partnership is composed of partners responsible for their own fundraising, decisions about allocating resources may not be a big issue. But if partners raise funds together, decisions about the allocation of resources become very important. In a similar way, partnerships of CSOs that focus primarily on service provision (for example, in health care), decisions about positioning in a political debate may not be very important. The opposite is the case for partnerships that focus on lobbying and advocacy. In PAT 1.0, we included a generic list of examples of decisions, but this sometimes caused confusion and unnecessary discussions. That’s why we did not include a generic list in the main text of this PAT 2.0. Nonetheless, a generic list (see below) can be useful as part of Step One, provided it is handled with care. The facilitator should avoid lengthy discussions about this list. Some of these decisions may be important in your partnerships, whereas others are not important at all. Please note that in your partnership, there can be decisions that don’t feature at all in this generic list.",
		"question9": "Step 1. is about identifying and listing important decisions to be made in the partnership. How can important decisions be formulated in an unambiguous and meaningful way?",
		"answer9": "The challenge is to formulate decisions that are balanced between being too general and too specific. For example, Decisions about the allocation of resources can be a formulation that is too broad for having a meaningful discussion. Every partner will, in one way or another, have some decision-making power in allocating resources. This issue is, at what level?

		"answer9b": "Decisions about the allocation of resources among partners in a country",
		"answer9c": "Decisions about the allocation of resources to specific projects T",

If the subcategorization is too detailed, such discussions may end up in tiresome and time-consuming splitting of hairs. Avoid this by focusing on the big issues."
